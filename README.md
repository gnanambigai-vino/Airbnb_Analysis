•	**Programming Language**: Python
•	**Database**: MongoDB Atlas
•	**Web Framework**: Streamlit
•	**Data Visualization**: Plotly Express
•	**Data Manipulation**: Pandas
•	**Database Connection**: pymongo
**Workflow**
**Project Initialization:**
•	Set up project directories and files.
•	Download and organize necessary assets, such as logos and images.
**Data Retrieval and Database Connection:**
•	Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas.
•	Retrieve the Airbnb dataset from the database.
**Streamlit Web Application Development:**
•	Set Streamlit page configurations, including title, icon, layout, and sidebar state.
•	Create a Streamlit web application with different sections for "Home" and "Explore Data."
•	Use the Streamlit Option Menu to enable navigation between sections.
**Home Section:**
•	Display a centred headline using st.markdown.
•	Provide information about the technologies used, project overview, and domain.
•	Optionally, display images or logos.
**Explore Data Section:**
•	Load the Airbnb dataset into a Pandas Data Frame.
•	Use Streamlit sidebar widgets for user interaction (e.g., multiselect for filtering data).
•	Visualize pricing variations, room type distribution, and neighborhood group insights using Plotly Express.
•	Display dynamic plots for room type and neighborhood group-wise pricing.
•	Provide interactive features like data download buttons.
**Conclusion**
The Airbnb Analysis project successfully leverages MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, and Plotly Express to provide valuable insights into Airbnb data. Through interactive geospatial visualizations and dynamic plots, the project addresses key aspects such as pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The streamlined Streamlit web application facilitates user exploration of diverse data filters and offers a comprehensive dashboard for a consolidated view.
